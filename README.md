# APCSFinalProject
Here's the prototype doc

Group name: Galago

Members: Jonathan Ho, Kirsten Szeto

Project description: Galaga-inspired (just galaga) game.  Weâ€™re gonna have most of the aspects that the actual Galaga game has including a player controlled spaceship, enemies that attack the player, and different types of enemies.  Certain groups of enemy ships will move in geometrical patterns while others move horizontally across the screen. We may implement a boss fight after a certain amount of time depending on our progress. Weâ€™re gonna add a life system and 1-ups as the original game has and a score counter. Weâ€™ll add sound effects if applicable. hehe ðŸ§›
